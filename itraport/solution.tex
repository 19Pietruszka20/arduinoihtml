I chose basic programming like html, css, javascript, php and of course C on arduino. I chose it because I could find really good guides on youtube-pasja informatyki and a lot of other video stuff with creating charts with javascript libaries. It is diffucult to learn something like angular or something without know the basics. Also it is smaller amount of guides because it is hard to master something, lets say big amount of programming. \newline

I thought about sending data from arduino to WebPage but finally i did it with database which i think is better. Data is send from arduino to database and then WebPage receive this data from database and create charts.\newline
I did my WebPage with a lot of htmls, css, javascript, php files which isn't that good,although it is ok, could be better with database, but there was small amount of time to do that project. 


\frac{dQ}{dt}=Q_{in}-Q_{out}+P\\
\frac{dV\cdot\rho \cdot c_{w}}{dt}=F\cdot \rho \cdot c_w \cdot T_{in}-F\cdot \rho\cdot c_w\cdot T_{out}+P\\
\frac{dT_{out}}{dt}=\frac{F}{V}\cdot(T_{in}- T_{out})+\frac{1}{V\cdot \rho \cdot c_w}\cdot P\\
K(s)=\frac{\Delta T_{out}}{\Delta P}=\frac{\frac{1}{V\cdot \rho \cdot c_w}\cdot\frac{V}{F}}{\frac{V}{F}s+1}\\
G=\frac{1}{V\cdot \rho \cdot c_w}\cdot\frac{V}{F}\\
\tau=\frac{V}{F}//

How we can do the WebPage? We can do it with standard languages or extensive frameworks like for example Angular. Firstly i thought about do html, css files which i need to create my WebPage. WebPage can exist because html files. Css files are for better look of the webpage. I thought about how my webpage will look like. I created html and css files and wrote lines of code in this files. Secondly i thought about elements which i must buy to send data from arduino sensors to database. I bought ArduCam with esp inside it, but something wasn't working, so then i bought Ethernet-Shield. Then i thought how to implement code in arduino environment. I didn't manage to properly implement it to send data from sensors by ethernet shield. In future i will try again or do it by python. After it i created javascript files and php files. Javascript files cause drawing charts and php files cause connect database with my webpage.
